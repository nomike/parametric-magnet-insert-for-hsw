An insert for the honeycomb storage wall which holds a disc magnet.
This allows for objects which are ferromagnetic to be stored on the wall easily.

The design features a small hole which allows for the magnet to be pushed out from the back side.

If you put in the exact diameter of your magnet you will be able to press-fit it without using glue.
